-- +migrate Up

-- P1 — bind groups to projects, and give the removal cascade somewhere to live.
--
-- Two things land here, both Project-owned tables:
--   1. `octo_project_member.removing` — the "seat closing" flag (D4)
--   2. `octo_project_member_removal_cleanup` — the project-side cascade outbox (D5)
--
-- `group.project_id` deliberately does NOT live here. It is in
-- modules/group/sql/20260906000001_group_project_binding.sql, and that file
-- explains why: modules/group's test binary does not register modules/project,
-- so a column modules/group reads and writes cannot ship from this directory.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. octo_project_member.removing
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- D4 — the cascade closes the seat FIRST and detaches groups after.
--
-- `removing` is set to 1 in the same transaction that begins removal, while
-- `status` stays 1. Every authorization read — the project member list, the
-- group admission gate, the middleware's role resolution — treats removing = 1
-- as a non-member. Keeping status = 1 until the detach finishes is what makes
-- I2 never LITERALLY violated by the removal itself: the group_member rows that
-- have not been cleaned up yet still belong to a member of record. The worker
-- flips status to 0 and clears removing in its final transaction.
--
-- Re-admission during the window CANCELS rather than being rejected: adding the
-- uid back inside a transaction holding the project row lock clears `removing`,
-- leaves status = 1, and marks the outstanding job cancelled. Rejecting instead
-- would make an unrelated admin action fail for as long as the cascade takes,
-- and the cascade can legitimately run long.
ALTER TABLE `octo_project_member`
  ADD COLUMN `removing` TINYINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
  COMMENT '1=席位正在关闭（D4）。status 仍为 1，但所有授权读一律按非成员处理；worker 完成后置 status=0 并清零';

-- The "removing stalled" reconcile scan looks for rows stuck at removing = 1
-- past a configured age, and it is a SEPARATE alert from I2 with the opposite
-- meaning: I2 says the invariant broke, this says the machinery stopped.
--
-- `updated_at` is the stall anchor rather than a dedicated removing_at column,
-- and that is only valid because of a property this schema has to keep: while
-- removing = 1, NOTHING else writes the row. The worker re-reads under lock but
-- does not write until its final transaction, and the only other write that can
-- land is re-admission, which clears removing and takes the row out of this
-- index range anyway. If a future change starts touching member rows mid-cascade
-- the stall alert goes silent — add removing_at then rather than debugging why
-- on-call stopped being paged.
--
-- A low-cardinality leading column is the right shape here precisely because the
-- distribution is skewed: removing = 1 is a handful of rows out of the table, so
-- the scan reads only what it needs and stays bounded on rows EXAMINED, which
-- TestReconcileQueriesAreBounded requires.
CREATE INDEX `idx_octo_project_member_removing` ON `octo_project_member` (`removing`, `updated_at`);

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. octo_project_member_removal_cleanup
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- D5 — the project-side cascade is its OWN outbox, not another step on the
-- Space job. Three reasons, all structural:
--
--   (a) keying. The Space job is keyed (space_id, uid). Project removal is
--       keyed (project_id, uid) and one uid can be removed from one project
--       while staying in others in the same Space.
--   (b) lease sizing. The Space job shares ONE 10-minute lease across its group,
--       conversation and project steps, and issue #797 documents that a single
--       job on a large Space can already outrun it. Project removal fans out
--       over every group in the project — project-sized work inside a lease
--       sized for Space cleanup.
--   (c) blast radius. modules/space/member_removal.go:56-64 states the step
--       contract: a returned error reruns the WHOLE job including the steps
--       that already succeeded. Hanging project cleanup off that job makes a
--       project-side failure re-drive the Space-side steps.
--
-- Structurally copied from space_member_removal_cleanup
-- (modules/space/sql/20260821000001_*.sql) — lease owner + lease_until,
-- attempts, next_attempt_at, backoff, a terminal abandoned state, the same two
-- index shapes, retention purge — with the corrections that table's own history
-- earned:
--
--   * TIME IS APPLICATION-WRITTEN UTC, with no DEFAULT and no ON UPDATE. The
--     space table uses DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(3), which is the MySQL SESSION
--     timezone, and this repo has already shipped a metric broken by exactly
--     that: the member-removal age gauge compared a Go UTC clock against a
--     session-timezone column and read -28799 seconds under TZ=Asia/Shanghai
--     (modules/space/member_removal_metrics.go). One clock, in Go, in UTC.
--   * status carries a CANCELLED terminal state (3), which the space table has
--     no equivalent of. D4's re-admission path needs to retire an in-flight job
--     without it looking like either success or exhaustion, and without deleting
--     the row — a deleted job leaves no evidence that a cascade was cancelled.
--
-- Deliberately NOT unique on (project_id, uid): remove → re-add → remove must
-- enqueue a second job. The worker re-reads the member row under lock before
-- each batch, so a stale job for a member who has since been re-added resolves
-- to a no-op rather than to damage.

--   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM octo_project_member_removal_cleanup WHERE status = 0;
-- A discarded job means a member whose project seat is closed keeps their rows
-- in that project's groups, which the I2 reconcile scan will then report.
