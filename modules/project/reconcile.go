// reconcileRunning / metricsRunning are process-level reentrancy guards.
//
// Required, not defensive. config.Context.Schedule is backed by a timing wheel that fires
// `go task()` on every tick WITHOUT waiting for the previous run (timingwheel.go:117), so a
// scan that takes longer than its interval overlaps itself. modules/space guards its cleanup
// worker the same way and for the same reason (removalCleanupRunning). Here the overlap
// would also race the epoch-history map below.
// reconcileMaxPages bounds how many pages any one scan walks in a single tick.
//
// Without it a scan whose violation set keeps growing could run for an unbounded time on every
// tick, which is the opposite of what a bounded scan is for. Hitting the cap means the numbers
// reported this tick are a floor rather than a total — acceptable for an alerting signal,
// PROVIDED the next tick picks up where this one stopped. See reconcileCursors for why that
// proviso needed real work rather than a comment.
// A var rather than a const so a test can shrink the window and exercise the cross-tick
// resume path without seeding tens of thousands of rows. Not thread-safe; tests that change
// it must not run in parallel and must restore it.

// reconcileCursors carries each scan's position ACROSS ticks.
//
// This is load-bearing, not tidiness. Every cursor used to be a local variable initialised at
// the top of its scan, so each tick restarted from the beginning and the page cap meant the
// scans could only ever see the first reconcileMaxPages * ReconcileLimit rows — 25,000 at the
// defaults. Past that, later rows were NEVER examined: a project with a higher id could sit in
// permanent violation and no tick would look at it. The comment above claimed "the next tick
// continues", which is exactly the sort of claim the code has to actually implement.
//
// Semantics: a scan resumes from its saved cursor, and resets to the start once it reaches the
// end of the table (a short page). So the scans rotate through the whole keyspace across ticks
// instead of re-reading one window forever, which is the same "cursor rotation under a shared
// budget" shape the notify welcome ledger uses.
//
// A cursor may skip a row that was deleted or changed state mid-rotation. That is acceptable
// for an alerting scan and self-correcting: the next full rotation sees it again.
// A rotation also has to carry its RUNNING TOTAL, not just its position. The gauges report a
// whole-population number; if a tick only covers part of the keyspace, Set-ing that partial
// count would publish a value smaller than reality and an alert threshold would never fire.
// So each scan accumulates across ticks and publishes only when a rotation completes.

	// counted 1 (under-report); a (space, uid) pair removed and re-removed produced two

	// rejoined the Space still counted, alerting on nothing (false positive).
	//
	// So the scan walks octo_project_member rows — the actual leaked seats — deduplicated by
	// construction because (project_id, uid) is the primary key. A row counts only when an
	// abandoned job exists for its (space_id, uid) AND the user does NOT currently hold a Space
	// seat. The seat check uses CLEANUP semantics (space.status <> 0), matching the cascade, so a
	// banned Space is not reported as a leak.
	//
	// Paged with LIMIT + a primary-key cursor, per brief C3. The previous version was a single

// has observed per project.
//
// A mutex plus a plain map, NOT a sync.Map. The previous version reset the history with
// `lastSeenEpoch = sync.Map{}`, which is a data race twice over: assigning to a shared
// package variable is an unsynchronised write, and a sync.Map must not be copied at all
// (it contains a Mutex). With the timing wheel firing `go task()` per tick, two overlapping
// scans could hit that concurrently. The reentrancy guard above now prevents the overlap,
// but a diagnostic must not depend on a second mechanism for its own memory safety.
//
// Best-effort by construction, and labelled as such wherever it is reported. The
// authoritative guarantee that member_epoch never goes backwards is the WRITE discipline:
// every statement in this package is `member_epoch = member_epoch + 1`, never an absolute
// assignment, enforced by a source guard test. A read-only scan cannot establish
// monotonicity — it would have to remember the previous value, and it runs on every pod, so
// a "regression" it saw could just be two replicas reading either side of one increment.
// What this catches is the crude case: a value that went down on the SAME replica between
// two scans.
