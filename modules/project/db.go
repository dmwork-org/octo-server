// DB is the modules/project data-access layer.
//
// Two conventions this file follows deliberately, both because getting them wrong
// is silent:
//
//  1. **Explicit column lists on every write.** Not util.AttrToUnderscore. Two
//     columns must never appear in an INSERT or UPDATE: `active_name` is a STORED
//     generated column (MySQL rejects naming it with error 3105) and `is_official`
//     has no P0 writer by design. A reflective column list derives from struct
//     fields, so it would start writing either one the moment somebody adds the
//     field — and `is_official` would then be written with a value that happens to
//     equal the default, making the regression invisible. `member_epoch` is
//     likewise absent from the insert list: it takes the DDL default, so the ONLY
//     statement in this package that writes that column is `member_epoch =
//     member_epoch + 1`, which is what makes monotonicity checkable by grep.
//
//  2. **dbr backtick asymmetry.** Update / InsertInto / DeleteFrom take the bare
//     table name (dbr quotes it); From / Select need manual backticks. Getting it
//     backwards yields error 1064 on a reserved word, and the reconcile scans join
//     `space`, which IS reserved.

//   - vs. Space DISBAND: it takes `space_member ... FOR UPDATE` and THEN updates `space`
//     (modules/space/db.go:71-88, an Error 1213 incident note). So a caller that holds
//     X(`space`) and then asks for this shared lock closes a cycle. createProject was that

//
// changed=false means the uid already held an active seat with this role, i.e. a
// no-op — and the caller must then NOT bump member_epoch. MySQL's affected-rows
// for INSERT .. ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE is 1 for an insert, 2 for a real update
// and 0 when the update would set every column to its current value, so 0 is
// exactly "nothing changed". Testing `!= 1` instead would classify every
// reactivation as a no-op.
//
// The role is only reset on reactivation, never on a row that is already active:
// re-adding a member who happens to be an admin must not silently demote them.
//
// ⚠️ ASSIGNMENT ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. MySQL evaluates ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
// assignments left to right, and a column read on the right-hand side sees the value
// written by any PRECEDING assignment in the same statement. So every clause that tests
// the OLD status must come before `status = 1`. An earlier draft put
// `updated_at = IF(status = 0, ...)` after it: `status` was already 1 by then, the
// condition was permanently false, and reactivating a member silently kept the
// updated_at from when they were first removed. Verified on MySQL 8.0.33 — with the
// clause after `status = 1` the timestamp does not move; before it, it does.

// checkSpaceMembershipForWriteTx, which JOINs `space` — a table outside the `FOR SHARE OF`

// ZERO owners — a state P0 cannot repair (role change and disband are owner-only) and no
// reconcile scan detects. What made it invisible is that each transaction re-reads its OWN
// membership row FOR UPDATE and so sees fresh data; only the aggregate authorising the write
// was stale.
