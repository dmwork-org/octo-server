	// treats it as nonexistent.
	StatusDisbanded = 0
	// StatusNormal — active.
	StatusNormal = 1
)

// Member status (octo_project_member.status). Rows are never deleted, so
// re-adding a member is a status flip rather than an INSERT that a unique index
// could reject.

	// MemberStatusRemoved — the seat is gone but the row stays for audit.
	MemberStatusRemoved = 0
	// MemberStatusActive — an active seat. I1 constrains exactly these rows.

// load-bearing: the transitive-protection rules compare roles numerically.

// Named for what it is. These values filter the Space project list and directory
// search; they are NOT a security boundary — a Space admin can still enumerate

// P0 has NO self-service join path — the invite surface is P2 — so the column exists with
// its DDL default and NOTHING above the storage layer reads or writes it. Same treatment as
// is_official: no model field, no request field, no response field. A client-visible
// join_mode with no enforcement point would let deployments persist join_mode=0 today and
// hand every such row open-join semantics the day the P2 path lands, with nobody
// re-consenting (yujiawei S-2, PR #841).

// and MySQL rejects any INSERT/UPDATE that names it with error 3105. The DAO uses
// explicit column lists rather than util.AttrToUnderscore, so this is belt and
// braces rather than the only guard — but a struct field would make the failure
// reachable again the moment someone reaches for the reflective helper.
//
// It likewise has no IsOfficial field: no P0 code path writes that column, and
// leaving it out of the model is what makes that checkable rather than aspirational.
