// PR #841 review round 4 (yujiawei P1-1 / P1-2). The actor-Space-seat arms added to
// updateProjectHandler and disbandProjectHandler in round 3 have no `return`.
//
// Go's switch cases do not fall through to the next case — but they do fall OUT of the switch,
// so control resumes on the handler's SUCCESS path:
//
//	update:  toResp(nil) dereferences the model -> handler PANIC, after having written a
//	         project.update audit entry for a write that was refused and never reached the DB.
//	disband: no panic (a nil slice is fine), so instead it writes a project.disband audit entry
//	         with seats_closed=0 for a disband that was REFUSED, then calls c.ResponseOK() on
//	         top of the already-rendered error envelope — two JSON bodies under one 400.
//
// On a PR whose purpose is authorization correctness, an audit record claiming a destructive
// operation succeeded when it was denied is the worst of the three symptoms.
//
// The round-3 guard could not see any of it: `assert.Contains(body, "errActorNotSpaceMember")`
// checks that the arm EXISTS, not that it terminates. The round-3 mutation table records
// "delete the arm -> guard red" and nothing for "the arm is wrong", which is the same gap this
// PR ships a learning note about.
