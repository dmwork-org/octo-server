// Lock order for every write path in this module, followed without exception:
//
//	space_member  ->  space  ->  project  ->  group  ->  group_member  ->  octo_project_member
//
// Concretely: a membership write locks the octo_project row (lockActiveProjectTx)
// BEFORE it touches octo_project_member, and the Space-side facts it needs
// (CheckMembership, MemberRole) are read before that lock is taken. P0 touches no
// group table at all, so the two middle positions are reserved for P1's group
// admission; recording them now is what keeps P1 from choosing a different order
// and deadlocking against this code.
//
// space_member leads space, and that is NOT this module's choice — it is
// modules/space's, recorded at modules/space/db.go:71-88 after an Error 1213 incident:
// both Space-disband paths take `space_member ... FOR UPDATE` and then update `space`,
// so any transaction taking those two in the opposite order closes a cycle with them.
// createProject is the only path here that takes both, and it took them backwards until
// PR #841 round 2 (yujiawei P1-3 / Jerry-Xin B-3); the deadlock was reproduced against
// MySQL 8.0.33 with the OPERATOR'S DISBAND as InnoDB's victim.
//
// Scope of this claim, stated because two earlier versions of this comment overstated it:
//
//   - it has been checked against modules/space's disband and member-removal transactions,
//     not just this module's own. "No cycle within this module" is not the property that
//     matters.
//   - it is a TABLE order, and a table order cannot express ordering among the ROWS of one
//     table. That is where round 3's remaining cycle lived: several paths locked two or three
//     space_member rows in sequence while modules/space's disband scan locks them row by row
//     in id order. Rows are therefore not ordered by convention at all — every path takes all
//     of its space_member locks in ONE statement (requireSpaceSeatsTx) and lets InnoDB choose,
//     and retryOnLockConflict is the backstop for whatever this reasoning still misses.
//
// Every membership and role write follows the same three steps inside one
// transaction:
//
//	1. lock the project row
//	2. write the membership row
//	3. IF step 2 affected a row, member_epoch = member_epoch + 1
//
// Step 3's condition is not an optimization. The Space-removal cascade step is
// re-executed on every job retry, so an unconditional bump would inflate the epoch
// on no-op reruns and break the "a no-op write does not change the epoch" rule that
// clients cache against.

// txRetryAttempts bounds the retry budget for transient lock conflicts. Three: enough for the
// pathological interleaving to have passed, few enough that a genuine hot spot surfaces as an
// error rather than as latency.
const txRetryAttempts = 3

// retryOnLockConflict re-runs fn while it fails with a TRANSIENT lock conflict.
//
// Why this exists even though the seat locks are now taken in one statement: three consecutive
// review rounds each found a lock-order cycle that careful reasoning had missed — table order
// vs. modules/space, then row order within space_member. "We reasoned about the order" is
// demonstrably not sufficient on its own, and the cost of being wrong is not a retry, it is
// store_failed (Internal, HTTP 500) — and when InnoDB picks the Space disband as its victim, a
// failed step of the member-removal security cascade.
//
// Only 1213 (deadlock) and 1205 (lock wait timeout) are retried, matching
// modules/common's isRetryableTxErr. Everything else — 1062, every service sentinel — is
// returned verbatim on the first attempt, so callers' errors.Is checks are untouched. fn must

// It is the ONLY way this module takes a space_member lock on a write path, which is what lets

//
//   - the ACTOR earns the same structural guarantee as the target. The middleware checks Space
//     membership before the transaction, through the shared space:member cache, so that
//     guarantee otherwise depends on another module's cache hygiene — and on a cache whose
//     DEL-failure fallback is best-effort.
//   - the TARGET's absence must be observable inside the transaction, or a Space removal can
//     commit between the check and the write.
//
// One statement, because two sequential row locks on space_member reopen the Error 1213 cycle
// with modules/space's disband scan — see lockSpaceSeatsTx for the mechanism and the
// reproduction. Paths that need only their own seat still go through here, so there is exactly
// one way to take these locks and the guard test can count call sites.
//
// actorUID is always first and always required. others are the target / successor, and their
// absence is TARGET-level: the caller is fine, the subject of the operation is not. Empty
// strings in others are ignored, which is what lets the optional transfer_to be passed
// unconditionally.

// an ordinary member — or an owner who is not the last one — was refused for naming a successor
// who had left the Space, even though no transfer was going to happen (PR #841 round 4, P2-4).

	//     could then clean up (the cascade closes seats, and an ownerless project cannot be
	//     disbanded).
	//
	//   * Deadlock: this used to come SECOND, and that is the exact reversed order
	//     modules/space/db.go:71-88 records as a prior Error 1213 incident. Both Space-disband
	//     paths (disbandSpace, forceDisbandSpace) take `space_member ... FOR UPDATE`

	//     reproduced against MySQL 8.0.33: InnoDB chose the OPERATOR'S DISBAND as the victim

// promoteSuccessorTx promotes a successor whose Space seat was ALREADY verified and locked
// by the caller (requireSpaceSeatsTx, before lockActiveProjectTx) to owner.
//
// The Space-seat check is the point. Checking only for an active PROJECT seat is not enough:
// the Space-removal cascade is asynchronous, so a user removed from the Space keeps their
// project seat until the cleanup job runs. Promoting them hands ownership to a seat that is
// already scheduled for closure — and once the cascade closes it the project has no owner at
// all, which is unrecoverable in P0 (role change and disband are owner-only, and a Space admin
// has read access only). The predicate is the authorization one, so a banned Space does not
// qualify a successor either.
//
// The check itself lives in requireSpaceSeatsTx so the shared space_member lock is
// taken BEFORE the project row — restoring the declared space -> project order on every path
// that needs it. The earlier placement (shared lock taken while holding the project row, with
// a no-cycle argument relying on the removal path taking its project lock only in a LATER
// transaction) was incomplete: InnoDB queues a shared-lock request BEHIND an already-waiting
// exclusive request on the same row, and modules/space does take exclusive space_member locks
// (disband takes a range). A three-way cycle was reachable; this placement removes it instead
// of arguing about it. (yujiawei Q2, PR #841 round 1.)
